Because of the sheer amount of data, it\u2019s an interesting problem, but you could generally work with the researchers to impose good I&#x2F;O behavior that gets around the POSIX constraints peculiarities of the particular filesystems. You want 100,000,000 cpu hours on a $200M computer? You can do the work to make the filesystem writes easier on the system.</p><p>Coming into private industry was a real eye-opener. You\u2019re in-house staff and you don\u2019t get to say who can use the computer. People use the filesystems for IPC, store 100M files of 200B each, read() and write() terabytes of data 1B at a time, you name it. If I had $100 for every job in which I saw 10,000 cores running a stat() in a while loop waiting for some data to get written to it by one process that had long since died, I\u2019d be retired on a beach somewhere.</p><p>The problem with POSIX I&#x2F;O is that it\u2019s so, so easy and it almost always works when you expect it to. GPFS (what I\u2019m most familiar with) is amazing at enforcing the consistency. I\u2019ve seen parallel filesystems and disk break in every imaginable way and in a lot of ways that aren\u2019t, but I\u2019ve never seen GPFS present data inconsistently across time where some write call was finished and it\u2019s data didn\u2019t show up to a read() started after the write got its lock or a situation where some process opened a file after the unlink was acknowledged. For a developer who hasn\u2019t ever worked with parallel computing and whose boss just wants them to make it work, the filesystem is an amazing tool. I honestly can\u2019t blame a developer who makes it work for 1000 cores and then gets upset with me when it blows up at 1500. I get grouchy with them, but I don\u2019t blame them. (There\u2019s a difference!)</p><p>But as the filesystems get bigger, the amount of work the filesystems have to do to maintain that consistency isn\u2019t scaling. The amount of lock traffic flying back and forth between all the nodes is a lot of complexity to keep up with, and if you have the tiniest issue with your network even on some edge somewhere, you\u2019re going to have a really unpleasant day.</p><p>One of the things that GCE and AWS have done so well is to just abandon the concept of the shared POSIX filesystem, and produce good tooling to help people deal with the IPC and workflow data processing without it. It\u2019s a hell of a lot of work to go from an on-site HPC environment to GCE though. There\u2019s a ton of money to be made for someone who can make that transition easier and cheaper (if you\u2019ve got it figured out, you know, call me. I want to on it!), but people have sunk so much money into their parallel filesystems and disk that it\u2019s a tough ask for the C-suite. Hypothetically speaking, someone I know really well who\u2019s a lot like me was recently leading a project to do exactly this that got shut down basically because they couldn\u2019t prove it would be cheaper in 3 years.</p>", "points": null, "parent_id": 18327524, "story_id": 18321937, "children": [{"id": 18331312, "created_at": "2018-10-29T20:53:39.000Z", "created_at_i": 1540846419, "type": "comment", "author": "KaiserPro", "title": null, "url": null, "text": "<p>This is a lovely wedge of experience.</p><p>You are of course very correct that if you have a massive number of processes using files for IPC, things will fail in very strange ways.</p><p>One of the very positive things that AWS&#x2F;GCE provide is simple scalable primitives, with obvious metrics to measure limits.

To make significant profits, we need to sell services on top of our software products (this is essentially GBS and their &quot;strong&quot; sales people)2. To make very good profits, we need to make highly customizable software (for example AI and BI offerings).3. To make even more profit we need to make sure the software is tuned to the hardware we make.If one of those weakens the entire IBM portfolio and profits weaken dramatically.Here's problems in last 7 years tho:\n1. People moving to the cloud so the hardware business flatlines.\n2. Because people moved to the cloud they found replacements to IBM software.\n3. At the end of the day IBM is forced to deliver professional services on top of other companies' software and hardware (and services employees are not cheap).At some point the IBM execs must have had an epiphany that their AI offerings don't sell because they don't have a platform that sells other commodity cloud services on top of which AI components can be sold as high-priced addons.So thus IBM decided to do what it does best --- take control of the entire stack.With this acquisition IBM has the potential to become a next gen. cloud vendor. For example IBM has been trying to sell Bluemix as a hybrid PaaS/IaaS but haven't been very successful. The engineering team in Bluemix is weak and one way to really up the ante is getting access to top talent in the industry to do this (CoreOS team, Openshift.io team, linux kernel devs, distributed storage devs).", "points": null, "parent_id": 18321884, "story_id": 18321884, "children": [{"id": 18325346, "created_at": "2018-10-29T05:55:17.000Z", "created_at_i": 1540792517, "type": "comment", "author": null, "title": null, "url": null, "text": null, "points": null, "parent_id": 18325317, "story_id": 18321884, "children": [], "options": []}, {"id": 18325991, "created_at": "2018-10-29T09:14:13.000Z", "created_at_i": 1540804453, "type": "comment", "author": "k_bx", "title": null, "url": null, "text": "<p>What&#x27;s not clear here is that why would one company, which is dong pretty well, better every year, would want to be sold to another company, which doesn&#x27;t look well (from your own description), instead of just continuing growing and eventually &quot;winning&quot; the cloud market by themselves?

From a systems perspective it&#x27;s a big ball of mud and the lack of a formal interface makes it prohibitively difficult to change or replace its subsystems.</p><p>I don&#x27;t like that systemd performs ANSI animations on my machine&#x27;s serial console, for example. Have you seen the &quot;marquee&quot; animations it does when certain services start? I sure would like to force it to print sequential lines of text instead, but I can&#x27;t.</p><p>I don&#x27;t like that when systemd updated basic utilities like &quot;reboot&quot; I lost the ability to use them in a chroot. Even &quot;reboot -f&quot; which does not need to talk to init. I had to write my own one-liner to call reboot(2) myself not too long ago.</p><p>System components need to be well scoped and replaceable.

Who knows, what if they make the CEO of RedHat the CEO of IBM a la Satya Nadella and Microsoft?They have said that RedHat would remain an independent part of IBM as part of their cloud push. Let's take them at their word unless they prove us wrong.

Whenever you read about &#x27;rogue traders&#x27; they inevitably had to do a lot of stuff to disable all the various security systems trying to catch rogue traders.</p><p>Institutionally distrusting your own employees can lead to seriously messed up IT systems. It&#x27;s one of the reasons that bank employees are notoriously unable to access so many ordinary external websites, or services like Slack. It&#x27;s how you can get &quot;administrators&quot; that can&#x27;t read the logs of the service they supposedly administer. Encrypted messaging services in particular are poison to an org that&#x27;s trying to stop employees exfiltrating valuable data. Google can just about do a good job of it because it has an essentially unlimited budget, which it spends on rolling its own tools for absolutely everything and integrating it all into one uber-architecture. From an economics perspective this makes no sense - comparative advantage etc - and thus basically no other company can do it that way. They have to buy or deploy open source tools that use a wide array of threat models and security systems but 95% of them will assume a trusted admin.  Then try and hack things on top to restrict what rogue admins can do. It&#x27;s deeply unpleasant.</p>", "points": null, "parent_id": 23855636, "story_id": 23851275, "children": [{"id": 23857264, "created_at": "2020-07-16T09:33:56.000Z", "created_at_i": 1594892036, "type": "comment", "author": "GauntletWizard", "title": null, "url": null, "text": "<p>Having been in several situations - As Gaia admin, working for big budget low competence IT for a &quot;major&quot; company, and as a shoestring SRE on a household name that&#x27;s still held together by duct tape in some corners - it weird what is obvious, what is possible, and what level of escalation would be required for what kind of attack.

However in our case it was a single obscure &quot;Colin was here&quot; tweet.We had recently built an internal endpoint in one of the backend apps that takes a string and publishes it straight to the main breaking news Twitter account. This was integrated with a custom UI tool that the news desk people used to quickly break a story across TV, Twitter, the website etc with one click.I had a suspicion that this endpoint was how that tweet was published, but could not prove it. Many thoughts were going through my head.. \u201cis this an internal job, or did someone hack our backend system and somehow figured this out etc.. \u201cWe quickly returned to our desks, and straight away I greped our logs for &quot;tweeting&quot; as I developed that feature and was sure we logged that when the endpoint is called, but in the heat of the moment forgot that to \u201c-i\u201d as it the log message actually contained &quot;Tweeting&quot; (which cost us a few minutes). In the meantime there was panic around the business, people were putting out PR statements just in case it was a real hack, the tweet was deleted etc.Finally, with help from colleagues, we tracked down a &quot;Tweeting&quot; log message around the same time the tweet was published along with the HTTP request source IP, and traced it (just like in movies) to our secondary news studio in Central London. This is when one of the managers shouted &quot;I know a Colin who works there, he's a testing team manager!&quot;.We gave Colin a ring to understand what was going on, he had no idea about any of this but said he was doing some DR testing earlier of all tools that editors use, and wasn\u2019t really aware this would go out. As you can imagine, it could have been much worse.The entertaining bit was the 30 minutes of fame this mysterious Colin enjoyed on the internet, where many people were worried about the welfare of &quot;Colin&quot;, and it was picked up by various [1] news [2] websites.[1] <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/lukelewis/an-important-history-of-the-colin-was-here-meme-that-changed\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.buzzfeed.com/lukelewis/an-important-history-of-t...</a>\n[2] <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/lukelewis/an-important-history-of-the-colin-was-here-meme-that-changed\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.buzzfeed.com/lukelewis/an-important-history-of-t...</a>", "points": null, "parent_id": 23851275, "story_id": 23851275, "children": [], "options": []}, {"id": 23853011, "created_at": "2020-07-15T22:24:10.000Z", "created_at_i": 1594851850, "type": "comment", "author": "sleepyshift", "title": null, "url": null, "text": "In an attempt to mitigate the damage, Twitter appears to have blocked verified accounts from sending tweets.", "points": null, "parent_id": 23851275, "story_id": 23851275, "children": [], "options": []}, {"id": 23854291, "created_at": "2020-07-16T00:30:14.000Z", "created_at_i": 1594859414, "type": "comment", "author": "koolba", "title": null, "url": null, "text": "Did they send one out from Trump as well?

But, I believe that we should trust us instead of relying on third parties. They always change when businesses interest changes. This is where web3 is coming to play. Technologies like IFFS, safe network are coming. Looking at the scale issue, I guess this web3 takes at least 5 more years. But, this kind p2p technology is possible with small-scaled mesh. Mesh networks within our devices or families. From the beginning, I hate the idea of storing passwords in the third-party password manager. Later, I fell into the same trap because a managing lot of passwords is difficult. So, I building an open-source p2p password manger. Replicates the passwords within your devices, instead of storing everything at the vendor's cloud. It's half-way for the closed beta release. I would like to hear everyone's feedback on this idea.Thanks", "points": null, "parent_id": 23851275, "story_id": 23851275, "children": [{"id": 23856912, "created_at": "2020-07-16T08:17:15.000Z", "created_at_i": 1594887435, "type": "comment", "author": "HenryBemis", "title": null, "url": null, "text": "<p>How does that addresses the issue?\nFrom the looks of it, this was not a password attack, this was either an inside job or an abuse of an API.</p>", "points": null, "parent_id": 23856895, "story_id": 23851275, "children": [{"id": 23856976, "created_at": "2020-07-16T08:32:37.000Z", "created_at_i": 1594888357, "type": "comment", "author": "sch00lb0y", "title": null, "url": null, "text": "<p>It&#x27;s not addressing this issue.
